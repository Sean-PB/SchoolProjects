Lab5: Functions and Graphics

-----------
DESCRIPTION

In this lab there should be a test file that tests the subroutines implemented in the Lab5.asm
file. The subroutines in that file do a variety of things dealing with printing pixels using the 
MIPS bitmap.

-----------
FILES

-
Lab5.asm

This file contains the subroutines that I implemented. It is assembly code for MIPS.

-
lab5_s20_test.asm

This file contains the tests for the subroutines in Lab5.asm. This file was provided and not was
not modified by me.

-----------
INSTRUCTIONS

This program is intended to be run using the MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator (MARS). Lab5.asm
will not do anything on its own and needs a test file to see results.
