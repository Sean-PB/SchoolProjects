Lab 4: Sorting Integers

-----------
DESCRIPTION

In this lab the program takes user input from the program arguments in MIPS. Then, the
program prints these arguments to the screen. Next, the program converts the arguments
from hexidecimal to decimal and prints the decimal values to the screen. Finally, the
program then sorts those decimal values in ascending order and prints the sorted values
to the screen.
