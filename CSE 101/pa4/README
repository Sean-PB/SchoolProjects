                  possible commands:
                    -  make                makes Shuffle
                    -  make ListClient     make ListClient
                    -  make clean          removes binary files
                    -  make check1         runs valgrind on ListClient
                    -  make check2         runs valgrind on Shuffle with command line argument 35
