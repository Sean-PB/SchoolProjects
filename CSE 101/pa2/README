List.h          - This is the header file which contains the prototypes of the functions to be used
                  in List.c.

List.c          - This is the file which contains the full definitions of the functions of the List
                  ADT.

Graph.h         - This is the header file which contains the prototypes of the functions to be used
                  in Graph.c.

Graph.c         - This is the file which contains the full definitions of the functions of the Graph
                  ADT.

GraphTest.c     - Tests Graph operations in isolation.

                  -     make                     makes FindPath
                  -     make GraphTest           makes GraphTest
                  -     make clean               removes binaries
                  -     make checkFind           tests FindPath for memory leaks on in3
                  -     make checkTest           tests GraphTest for memory leaks
