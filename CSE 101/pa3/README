README

List.h              - This is the header file which contains the prototypes of the functions to be
                    used in List.c.

List.c              - This is the file which contains the full definitions of the functions of the
                    List ADT.

Graph.h             - This is the header file which contains the prototypes of the functions to be
                    used in Graph.c.

Graph.c             - This is the file which contains the full definitions of the functions of the
                    Graph ADT. I decided to simply add the new functionality needed for pa3 onto the
                    Graph module made in pa2. I chose to use the 4th implantation of visit mentioned
                    in the pa3 doc: Just give Visit() its own local copy of time, then let it take
                    the current value of time as input, and return the new value of time when it's
                    done.

GraphTest.c         - Tests Graph operations in isolation.

FindComponents.c    - This is the driver program which, when built, takes in an input and output
                    file.

README              - The file you're reading. Serves as a table of contents for the pa1 directory.

Makefile            - The Makefile is what builds the executables. The following lines describe
                    possible commands:
                        -  make                     makes FindComponents
                        -  make GraphClient         makes GraphClient
                        -  make clean               removes binaries
                        -  make checkFind           tests FindComponents for memory leaks on in3
                        -  make checkClient         tests GraphClient for memory leaks
