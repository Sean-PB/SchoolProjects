                  in List.c.

List.c          - This is the file which contains the functionality of the List ADT.

Lex.c           - This is the driver program which, when built, takes in an input and output file.
                  Each line of the input file will be indirectly lexicographically sorted and
                  printed into the given output file in ascending lexicographic order.

                  -     make ListClient        makes ListClient
                  -     make clean             removes all binaries
                  -     make checkClient       checks ListClient for memory errors
                  -     make checkLex          checks Lex for memory errors
